This is a Homebrew tap that provides formulae for the Unix version of the Hugo command-line tools (https://bitbucket.org/0branch/hugo-unix) as well as for any needed dependencies that are not in homebrew-core.

To install the Hugo tools, first add the tap with:

    brew tap realnc/hugo

You can then install the tools with:

    brew install hugo-unix

This will install three executables:

* `hc` - Compiler
* `hd` - Debugger
* `he` - Interpreter
